It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n","\n","In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n","\n","![alt text](https://www.kdnuggets.com/images/reinforcement-learning-fig1-700.jpg)\n","\n","While the ultimate goal of reinforcement learning is to teach agents to act in the real, physical world, simulated environments -- like games and simulation engines -- provide a convenient proving ground for developing RL algorithms and agents.\n","\n","In previous labs, we have explored both supervised (with LSTMs, CNNs) and unsupervised / semi-supervised (with VAEs) learning tasks.

The idea of discounting rewards is similar to discounting money in the case of interest.\n","\n","To compute the expected cumulative reward, known as the **return**, at a given timestep in a learning episode, we sum the discounted rewards expected at that time step $t$, within a learning episode, and projecting into the future.

For example, in autonomous driving, traditional methods work by first detecting road and lane boundaries, and then using path planning and rule-based methods to derive a control policy. Deep learning offers something very different -- the possibility of optimizing all these steps simultaneously, learning control end-to-end directly from raw sensory inputs.\n","\n","**You will explore the power of deep learning to learn autonomous control policies that are trained *end-to-end, directly from raw sensory data, and entirely within a simulated world*.**\n","\n","We will use the data-driven simulation engine [VISTA](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957584&tag=1), which uses techniques in computer vision to synthesize new photorealistic trajectories and driving viewpoints, that are still consistent with the world's appearance and fall within the envelope of a real driving scene. This is a powerful approach -- we can synthesize data that is photorealistic, grounded in the real world, and then use this data for training and testing autonomous vehicle control policies within this simulator.\n","\n","In this part of the lab, you will use reinforcement lerning to build a self-driving agent with a neural network-based controller trained on RGB camera data. We will train the self-driving agent for the task of lane following. Beyond this data modality and control task, VISTA also supports [different data modalities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12083.pdf) (such as LiDAR data) and [different learning tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12137.pdf) (such as multi-car interactions).\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/master/lab3/img/vista_overview.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n","</p>\n","\n","\n","You will put your agent to the test in the VISTA environment, and potentially, on board a full-scale autonomous vehicle! Specifically, as part of the MIT lab competitions, high-performing agents -- evaluated based on the maximum distance they can travel without crashing -- will have the opportunity to be put to the ***real*** test onboard a full-scale autonomous vehicle!!! \n","\n","We start by installing dependencies.

Congratulations on training two RL agents and putting them to the test!

The prize for this lab includes an opportunity to test your model and algorithm onboard a full-scale autonomous vehicle in the real world.**\n","\n","To get you started, here are some suggested ways to improve your self-driving car model and/or RL algorithm:\n","\n","* different model architectures, for example recurrent models or Transformers with self-attention;\n","* data augmentation and improved pre-processing;\n","* different data modalities from different sensor types. VISTA also supports [LiDAR](https://driving.ca/car-culture/auto-tech/what-is-lidar-and-how-is-it-used-in-cars) and [event-based camera](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01310.pdf) data, with a [new VISTA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12083.pdf) describing this.

Not reinforcement learning, but a powerful algorithm to leverage human data to provide additional supervision the learning task.\n","\n","To enter the competition, MIT students and affiliates should upload the following to the course Canvas:\n","\n","* Jupyter notebook with the code you used to generate your results, **with the self-driving car agent training fully executed**;\n","* **saved video of your self-driving agent executing a trajectory in VISTA**;\n","* printout / recording of the **maximum distance traveled by your agent** before crashing;\n","* **text description and/or visual diagram** of the architecture, settings, algorithm, hyperparameters, etc you used to generate your result -- if there are any additional or interesting modifications you made to the template code, please include these in your description;\n","* finally, **separate `.py` script** containing the code for your model, as well as **a function call to load your model and the final trained weights**.
