# Sublime Configuration
I prefer to use Sublime text for my reading notes, instead of google colab. Althought it's faster and lighter, you do need pay off at cofiguraing and package installation.

## How to show math equation
1. Learn how to do configuration from [here](https://granneman.com/webdev/editors/sublime-text/configuring-sublime-text#changing-preferencessublime-settings).
2. Follow the notes below to search and solve.
> ## Math
> Math can be displayed in the browser using **MathJax or Katex. The feature can be enabled by correctly configuring the `"js"`, `"css"`, and `"markdown_extensions"` configuration fields.** This allows for inline math to be included \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\) $\pi$.
> 
> Alternatively, math can be written on its own line:
> 
> $$F(\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \, e^{ - i \omega t}dt$$
> 
> \\[\int_0^1 f(t) \mathrm{d}t\\]
> 
> \\[\sum_j \gamma_j^2/d_j\\]
