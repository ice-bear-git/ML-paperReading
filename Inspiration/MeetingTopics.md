# Meeting Topic

## Feb 28
* Specificity in "Transformer" Paper
* Resource: Pitt [CRC](https://crc.pitt.edu) guideline: [computational resource](https://crc.pitt.edu/getting-started)
* Go deeper or wider: 
	- View the mathmatical analysis as post-Emperical explanation or a leading guidline? 
* E-seminar: Understanding Neural Net Training Dynamics in Tractable Slices
	- The best way to train an rNN is in hard coding manner, or borrow power from RL to pick up the best parameter sets. While, before touching/turning to those last resource, there still be many theoretical improving space for ML itself: Like schedule, optimizer, and attention/transformer? (Relates to Soon's question)
		+ You prefer which side?
		+ If we applying theoretical architecture to real-world problem (saying dynamics problem), we still should use RL to fill/minimize the gap between Theoretical and Practical world.


* Setup a Weekly Meeting schedule?
