# MLPaperReading
This repository will record all of my ML paper reading reflection and [experiment](https://github.com/ice-bear-git/ML-paperReading/tree/main/CodeBase) from Feb 2022. At the starting stage, I will divide paper based on the reading time. While as the number of paper growth up, I will organized them in terms of fields and topics. Let's see how much I can learn from paper reading.


## Paper list
I will list them down based on reading timeline with a topic specification at the front.
* **[Transformer/Attention]** [How Do vision transformers works?](https://github.com/ice-bear-git/ML-paperReading/blob/main/Paper_Feb/How%20Do%20vision%20transformers%20works.md)
	- More relates to Experimental and Theoretical Understanding
* **[Noise Injection]** [Anticorrelated Noise Injection for Improved Gene](https://github.com/ice-bear-git/ML-paperReading/blob/main/Paper_Feb/Anticorrelated%20Noise%20Injection%20for%20Improved%20Gene.md)
	- With Solid Math Proving
